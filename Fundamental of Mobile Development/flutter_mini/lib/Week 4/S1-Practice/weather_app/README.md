## A Weather App

This app shows a few weather information from various cities.

Due to the API's limitations, you can only see the past 2 days, today and the next 4 days.


#### Set up:

1. Install the required dependencies.
2. Go to [tomorrow.io](https://www.tomorrow.io/). and create an account to get the api key.
3. Make a `.env` file in and write `TOMORROW_API_KEY=` then add the key after.
